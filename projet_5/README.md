# Cross-compiler

This project is meant to build an OS image allowing the cross-compiling of a BLE service.

The project met its difficulties with both BLE and cross-compiler.

The BLE bloc(generic BLE in) is unable to read any data from a connected bluetooth device and the image building failed when the configuration menu is filled and an error is generated whilw using "make" command.
